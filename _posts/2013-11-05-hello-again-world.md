Why, hello there. Time to try this **yet again**.

I've decided to use Jekyll this time around, which should hopefully make it a
lot easier to make new posts and keep things up to date. The previous
incarnation of this "site" was just a single flat html page which wasn't really
backed up properly anywhere (oops), so this time at least I can keep everything
on github and write my posts in markdown.

Hopefully I will actually make some more posts soon though, perhaps even
interesting ones, that are relevant to people-other-than-me's interests. Until
that time, you can check out some [code on my github profile][github], see what
[music I like to listen to][lastfm] and look at some [random ramblings on
twitter][twitter], which I actually don't use often at all anymore...

If you guys know anything that you'd like me to write a post about, feel free to
ping me on twitter since the main reason I don't really write posts is cause I
have no clue what to write about. Things I already know don't really seem worthy
to write about, but other people might be able to learn a lot. So please, feel
free to suggest some stuff!

Oh and, yes, the front page needs some... fixing. Still finding my way around
Jekyll and too lazy to really dig deep right now, I'll get around to it!
