title: A word on Tinker

So, as some of you may know, I have a little side project called
[Tinker][tinker]. As some of you also might know, Tinker is down at the moment,
and I'd like to a moment to explain how this exactly came to pass. This post is
somewhat difficult to write, so try to go easy on me...

Without wanting to sound too dramatic or anything, my life has been somewhat
chaotic the past 5-6 years, riddled with financial issues, moving around a lot
and a relationship that died. I am okay with all that though, since it affected
me, and me alone.

When Tinker went down, that wasn't the case. Tinker was never used by many
people, but there were still people that used it (roughly 2000 per month), and
kept their data on there. Since Tinker was something I did in my free time, I
never gave any kind of warranty.

It only ever cost me money, never generated any, but it was a labour of love. I
genuinely enjoy(ed) working on it every second, overcoming issues and eventually
[rewriting][rewrite] almost everything to make it more decoupled, making sure
each part of the application could be swapped out.

## It's gone now, like... gone, gone

I'll spare you the details, but due to my leaving London I was left without a
credit card, and those things aren't really common back in Holland (where I am
now), so I was unable to pay Linode. Aside from that I've also been horribly
broke the past months, so even if I had the money, I would not have been able
to afford it.

Due to not being able to pay the bill for the server and not being able to get a
credit card and such in time, Tinker's data is all gone. I can't even begin to
express how shitty I feel about this, but there's just literally no way of
getting it back at this point. The Linode it was on got securely deleted, so all
the data is **gone**.

Yes, I should have offered a way for users to retrieve their data in some
meaningful way, but I was broke, stressed and unable to give a fuck. But in
hindsight I feel like a selfish ass for not doing this, so I hope you can all
find it in your hearts to forgive me.

## The future

So what's going to happen with Tinker in the future? Truth is, I'm not entirely
sure; a part of me would really like to get it up and running again since it was
always a lot of fun to work on, but with today's "market" where there are plenty
of such tools available, I wonder if there is even a want/need for it anymore.

I initially created Tinker because back when I worked at Spotify, there was a
need for an internal code-sharing tool like [jsFiddle][jsfiddle]. I did some
looking around, but found that jsFiddle was closed-source and there were some
plans to do licensing in the future. I didn't really want to wait for that to
happen so I decided to cook something up myself, have some fun with it and make
it open-source while I was at it.

By now there are plenty of other open-source alternatives, [JS Bin][jsbin]
probably being the most used/popular at the moment. That said, I did always have
a bunch of, in my opinion, cool ideas for things to add to Tinker and make it
more useful to the end user, so perhaps there is still some kind of point to
continuing with Tinker and putting it back up.

So I guess it's at least partially up to you guys. Is there any point in me
keeping the [tinker.io][tinkerio] domain name and improving it again as I was
before? I know there's no comments section on this site and that's not likely to
change (for now, anyway), so if you want to be heard feel free to [ping me on
twitter][twitter].

Thanks for reading.
