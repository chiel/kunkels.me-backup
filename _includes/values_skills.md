As an all-round developer my current technologies of choice are HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and MongoDB. Aside from those arguably common technologies I'm also
keen on things that enable integration of technology into our daily lives.

Nowadays build tooling is almost just as important as writing great code,
enabling us to greatly improve our efficiency. I like to use [gulp.js][gulp] or
[Grunt][grunt] to tie everything together.

When it comes to JavaScript I like to write my code in CommonJS format, using
[Browserify][browserify] to bundle it all for browser consumption. This also
enables me to make use of the many excellent packages found on [npm][npm].

For CSS I try to embrace the [SMACSS][smacss] methodology along with either
[SCSS][scss] or [PostCSS][postcss] for preprocessing purposes. Lately I've been
drawn to the latter due to the modular fashion in which features are
implemented.

My colleagues have dubbed me *"the gitfather"* due to my extensive knowledge
of [Git][git], its workflows, my obsession with a clean history and willingness
to educate others on these topics.

Beyond writing code I enjoy thinking about software architecture and the
implications that may arise from decoupling and modularising a codebase.

I firmly believe that in order to build a great product, a great user experience
should guide most---if not all---technical decisions. Otherwise the duration of
the project will be spent battling with user experience versus technology.
