I'm a 28-year-old guy from Holland. I enjoy making digital stuff, which I
currently do for [Lifely][lifely] in Amsterdam. Since I have a bad case of
wanderlust I've previously lived in places such as Stockholm, London and
Saudi-Arabia.

Most people would classify me as a frontend developer, but I'm actually quite
all-round. Leveraging knowledge of both the light and dark side enables me to
come up with quality software architecture and write great code.

I work well in teams and enjoy the perks of having held jobs at companies of
various sizes. In recent years I've also gained experience in leading small
teams.

You can find some of my personal code on my [GitHub profile][github]. Aside from
coding I enjoy making and [listening to music][lastfm], going to concerts,
watching movies & series and travelling the globe. I also enjoy going out for a
[run][strava] or the odd skateboarding adventure every now and again.
