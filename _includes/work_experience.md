### Lifely

[Lifely][lifely] is a small group of people who are ridiculously passionate
about making products that simply work. They fully invest themselves into each
project and focus on delivering something that stays true to the concept.

I joined Lifely as a frontend developer, contributing to the development of
their latest project, [Part-up][partup], a startup that enables people to create
short-term, project-based teams.

All development for Part-up is being done in [Meteor][meteor], a fairly young
JavaScript framework which takes care of both front-- and backend, as well as
build tooling.

### Strangelove

[Strangelove][strangelove] is an Amsterdam-based creative agency for the "always
on" world. By using their knowledge of how businesses work they aim to provide
solutions that are relevant, human-friendly, memorable and above all, simple.

I was a digital developer at Strangelove. My first order of business was giving
the company website a much-needed makeover. I worked together closely with [the
motion graphics designer][ben] and experimented a lot with scrolling animations.

After that, my work shifted towards coming up with a CMS that would allow for a
lot of customisation, while still allowing the developers to work on a core that
is shared by most websites, eliminating duplicated efforts for each new project.

> Over time, our clientele grew more corporate and work was reduced to creating
> fairly standard websites. I wasn't really being challenged so I started to
> stagnate.

### TravelBird

[TravelBird][travelbird] is a travel organisation that aims to solve the paradox
of choice when it comes to picking a vacation destination. They work with
partners situated throughout Europe to provide daily deals at excellent prices.

At TravelBird I helped innovate the way we worked by splitting the front-- and
backend, communicating through an API. This enabled my fellow frontend engineers
and I to work on a decoupled codebase in areas we had expertise.

> Ultimately, the project I was working on got cancelled because it was not
> panning out as management had hoped. This resulted in ten engineers, myself
> included, getting laid off.

### Beamly

*Previously Zeebox*. [Beamly][beamly] creates a second-screen application for
your phone or tablet that displays contextual information, twitter feeds and
just about anything else based on what's happening on your TV screen.

At Beamly I worked in the Mission Control team, responsible for maintaining a
tool which allowed editors to enhance programmes with various widgets and
twitter feeds to make the TV-watching experience more engaging.

> I ended up leaving Beamly for personal reasons which I won't disclose here. I
> wanted to move back to the Netherlands so I looked for a job in the Amsterdam
> area.

### QMetric

[QMetric][qmetric] is an insurance company that leverages technology in order to
combat the often negative image insurance companies have. They prioritise their
customers' needs and aim to provide the best service possible.

At QMetric I worked on the [Policy Expert][policyexpert] website. Most of my
time was spent on optimising the various forms that enabled users to manage all
aspects of purchasing and managing their insurance, no matter what browser they
used.

I also helped think about decoupling the various components of the system into
micro services. This would make it easier to develop, test and deploy smaller
parts of the application rather than working with one monolithic codebase.

It is during this time I started working on the first incarnation of
[informal][informal]---a JavaScript library that helps build forms based on a
JSON schema. The schema could be shared with the backend to take care of
validation.

> While working here it occurred to me that working in the financial sector
> required a different kind of mindset than I possessed. My creativity wasn't
> really being challenged so I decided to move on.

### Spotify

[Spotify][spotify] is a music streaming service that enables its users to listen
to all the world's music at the press of a button. It also offers various ways
to discover new music through features such as Radio and Discover Weekly.

To say I learnt a lot at Spotify would be an understatement---working here was a
critical step in my career as a programmer. Before Spotify, the command line
and all its wonders were a scary place, shrouded in mystery.

I was also introduced to [Git][git]. Despite making many mistakes along the
way, the patience of my many awesome colleagues helped me overcome the arguably
steep learning curve of this crucial piece of technology.

I worked on a variety of projects---initially the regular (spotify.com) website
followed by a more frontend-heavy role helping to implement the Spotify Apps API
into the native client.

This allowed me to experiment with CSS3 and HTML5 features for months while
fleshing out an API layer around the raw calls exposed by the client code,
offering third-party developers an awesome app-development experience.

Lastly, I worked on the platform team creating the developer.spotify.com website
and attending various events locally and abroad. I also did the occasional
public speaking, evangelising the Spotify Apps API.

> I left Spotify because I felt it was time for a change of scenery---the long,
> dark Swedish winters got to me. London always had a bit of a magnetic grasp on
> me since I lived in the UK as a child so that's where I decided to move.

### Odd jobs

**Mediamatic**---At [Mediamatic][mediamatic] I worked on setting up new websites
in their Anymeta community management system. Most of the work was quite simple
and a little repetitive for my taste, with little opportunity to make a
difference.

**Lucius Websystems**---At [Lucius][lucius] I worked as a Drupal developer. I
created HTML and CSS templates and prepped these to be attached to a Drupal
backend. Occasionally I created small interactive components in JavaScript as
well.

**Grrr**---At [Grrr][grrr], I worked as a front-end developer, creating HTML/CSS
templates that would later be enriched by JavaScript. Work was mainly done for
various museums and the well-known (in the Netherlands) museum night.

**Submarine**---At [Submarine][submarine] I worked as an all-round web
developer, mainly creating accessible and valid HTML/CSS.

**Synetic**---At [Synetic][synetic] I worked on websites which were based on
their CMS, Procreate. Most of my time was spent in PHP and MySQL, doing lots
of under-the-hood work on thee CMS to improve performance and functionality.
